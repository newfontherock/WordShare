# WordShare
Wordle Clone... with Multiplayer! Besides playing the Wordle word of the day (answer is pulled from the NYTimes review page using Node.JS/express.js, see server folder), you can play the Wordle of the Day between two devices, each one taking a turn.  Or, you can share your own word for someone else to solve.

Borrowed the word list from the official game:

# ToDo: 

1) The animation of the word after the user wins.
2) The multiplayer part. Right now, it's Wordle with a different color scheme.
